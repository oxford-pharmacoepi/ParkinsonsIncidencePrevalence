## Introduction
This study focuses on the incidence and prevalence of parkinsonism and its subtypes (namely Parkinson's Disease, vascular parkinsonism and drug-induced parkinsonism) as well as the incidence and prevalence of the use of popular antiparkinson drugs (namely levodopa, dopamine agonists, MAO-B inhibitors, COMT inhibitors and amantadine). More specifically, this study will be completed via these three onjectives:
1) Calculate the annual incidence and period prevalence of parkinsonism and its subtypes from 2007 to now.
2) Calculate the annual incidence and period prevalence of the use of each drug from 2007 to now.
3) Calculate the annual incidence and period prevalence of ths use of each drug in each disease strata from 2007 to now.

## Running the analysis
1) Download this entire repository (you can download as a zip folder using Code -> Download ZIP, or you can use GitHub Desktop). 
2) Open the project <i>ParkinsonsIncidencePrevalence.Rproj</i> in RStudio (when inside the project, you will see its name on the top-right of your RStudio session)
3) Open and work through the <i>CodeToRun.R</i> file which should be the only file that you need to interact with. Run the lines in the file, adding your database specific information and so on (see comments within the file for instructions). The last line of this file will run the study <i>(source(here("RunStudy.R"))</i>.     
4) After running you should then have zip files as well as default plots in the Results output folder.
